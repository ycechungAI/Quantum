        "# Adapting Qiskit samples to run on Azure Quantum\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have some experience with quantum computing or are just starting, it is likely that you will use some samples from Qiskit.org. This Jupyter notebook walks you through 4 simple steps to adapt an existing Qiskit sample to run against any of the Azure Quantum back-ends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most samples are configured to run by default against the aer_simulator, which is a great way to get started.\n",
        "\n",
        "The aer_simulator is a local simulator, extremely performant, but different from a cloud simulator. When a local simulator is used, all jobs are computed \"in memory\" and there is no network latency nor job queue compared to an actual cloud backend (simulator or QPU). It enables you to run these simulations very quickly, but they may not accurately represent the behavior of a cloud backend.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you don't use a local simulator, you may experience total experiment duration that are orders of magnitude longer (from minutes for a local simulator, to hours or days for an actual back-end). \n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally a local simulator only uses the 'local' compute or a hosted compute. When using a cloud backend you may be spending money or credits, depending on what you selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make sure to perform tests on smaller experiments when selecting cloud backends."
