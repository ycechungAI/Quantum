# Estimating the ground state energy of hydrogen using variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) on Azure Quantum

This sample shows how to estimate the ground state energy of hydrogen using the Azure Quantum service. In particular, this sample uses the implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm provided with Qiskit to estimate minimum energies. The sample demonstrates running this VQE implementation the simulator provided by IonQ and on the emulator provided by Quantinuum.
